The survey, the first of its kind conducted by the Ministry, covered students from the fourth grade up. According to the survey, 22 per cent of the primary school children polled said they face bullying, compared with 13 per cent of junior high school children and 4 per cent of senior high school students. On the other hand, some 26 per cent of the primary school children said they have bullied, with the percentage decreasing to 20 per cent for junior high school children and 6 per cent for senior high school students. Of those who replied that they have been bullies, between 39 and 65 per cent said they also have been bullied. The survey indicated that 37 per cent of the parents of bullied primary school children were aware of bullying targeted at their children. The figure was 34 per cent for the parents of junior high school children and 18 per cent for those of the senior high school students. Of the parents aware of the bullying, 14 per cent to 18 per cent said they had been told of bullying by teachers. Only 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the parents learned of the bullying from their children, according to the survey. The survey also found that 42 per cent of primary school teachers are not aware of bullying aimed at their students. The portion of such teachers was 29 per cent at junior high schools and 69 per cent at senior high schools. Asked for the reason behind bullying, about 85 per cent of the teachers cited a lack of education at home. Many parents singled out a lack of a sense of justice and compassion among children as the main reason. An Education Ministry official said the findings suggest that parents and teachers should have closer contact with children to prevent bullying.
